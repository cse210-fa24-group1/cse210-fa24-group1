# How to Contribute to the Expense Tracker Repository

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the Expense Tracker project! By following these steps, you can help improve and enhance the repository.

## Steps to Contribute

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

- Since you're a part of the repository, clone the repository to your local machine directly:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/cse210-fa24-group1.git
  ```
- Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 2. **Fetch and Pull Latest Changes**

- After cloning, navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd cse210-fa24-group1
  ```
- **Fetch the latest changes** from the repository:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  ```
- **Pull the latest changes** from the `main` branch (or `master` if that’s the default branch) into your local repository:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
  This ensures that your local copy is up-to-date with the remote repository before creating a new branch.

### 3. **Create a New Branch**

- It's best practice to create a new branch for your changes. You can do this by running:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b add/feature-name
  ```
  or,
  ```bash
  git checkout -b bugfix/feature-name
  ```
- Replace `feature-name` with a descriptive name for the feature you are working on.

### 4. **Make Your Changes**

- Navigate to the appropriate file(s) and make your changes.
- Be sure to write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes you’ve made.
- **Commit message format**: Your commit message should include the tag to the current version of the project, e.g., `v1.2.0`, at the beginning of the message. For example:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "v1.2.0 - Add user authentication feature"
  ```

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**

- After making changes, commit them:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "v1.2.0 - Add feature for expense categories"
  ```

### 6. **Push Your Changes**

- Push your changes to your branch in the repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature-name
  ```

### 7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**

- Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the **New Pull Request** button.
- Select your branch with the changes and the base branch (usually `main` or `master`) of the original repository.
- **Edit the Pull Request Template**: Once the pull request template appears, make sure to fill it out with relevant details about your changes, including:
  - A brief description of the changes you made.
  - Any relevant issue numbers or links (if applicable).
  - Testing details, if you added new functionality or fixed a bug.
- Provide a detailed description of your changes and why they are beneficial to the project.

### 8. **Address Feedback**

- If the maintainers request changes or provide feedback, make the necessary updates to your branch.
- After addressing the feedback, commit and push the changes again. Your pull request will automatically update.

### 9. **Celebrate!**

- Once your pull request is reviewed and merged, your contribution is officially part of the repository. Thank you for helping improve the Expense Tracker project!
