# UI Decisions

## Status

Accepted.

## Current UI

The current UI is shaped for usability on a cell phone.
The existing UI consists of:

- An 'income' and 'expense' section that are unusable
- The calculated monetary balance
- Unsuable 'history' and 'add new transaction' options
- A text entry box and another extry box labeled "amount (negative - expense, positive - income)"
- 'Add transaction' and 'capture screenshot' cickable buttons
- A prompt to download the expense report after capturing a screen shot

## Intended Changes

- A login page (username and password)
- A 'create account' option
- A home page with spending history and categorization of items
- An 'enter' transaction feature with the description, amount, and category of expense (within this feature, the user can add new categories, save them, then search and select them later when adding new transactions)
- An edit budget limit option
- Buttons to navigate to the spending summary page and to logout of the expense tracker
- A spending visualizations page with a pie chart showing the percent of money spent in each category, a line graph showing weekly spending sorted by category, and a drop down menu to sort spending into weekly or monthly summaries

## Consequences

The changes will improve the usability and usefulness of this expense tracker for the user. It will allow the user to save their spending breakdowns from prior months, allow for categorization of expenses, and allow for the visualization of spending patterns.
