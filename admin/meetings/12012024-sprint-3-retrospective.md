## 1. **Liked**

_What went well during the sprint?_

- Cross-team collaboration
- Pair programming

### Examples:

- Having 4 people work on the various functionalities of the visualizations page was risky since it involved possible introduction of different styles of writing code.
- However due to agreement on a code quality document, we were able to ensure code quality & uniformity across teams.

## 2. **Lacked**

_What could have been better or brought the team closer to success?_
