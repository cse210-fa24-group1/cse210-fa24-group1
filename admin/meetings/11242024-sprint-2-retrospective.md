## 1\. Liked  
*What went well during the sprint?*

* Every task completed, apart from one  
* Pushes & merging to the main branch is more seamless now–issues from last sprint were resolved

**Examples:**

* We were able to update multiple ADRs: code quality, technical decisions, and technology decisions  
* We were able to clean up the project directory

## 2\. Lacked   
*What could have been better or brought the team closer to success?*

* We could have paid closer attention to details when it comes to specific processes   
* Trying more to keep items out of backlog will give us more time to finalize our repo before the code freeze

**Examples:**

* Remembering to include a reviewer and an assignee for each PR  
* We weren’t able to complete unit testing for the home page

## 3\. Learned  
*What lessons or insights were gained during the sprint?*

* We were able to adapt and move forward from struggles

**Examples:**

* Fixed our issues with pull request failure

## 4\. Longed for  
*What do we desire to enhance success or morale in future sprints?*

* We’re aiming to iron out/plan out specific details of our code  
* More communication over Mattermost for TA viewing and evaluations

**Examples:**

* Need to outline the dynamics of the homepage

**Next steps:**

* Complete unit testing for homepage  
* Link the “auth” and “home” page  
* Complete a code review to ensure it doesn’t look like more than one person wrote it  
* Implement more dynamic elements into the home page  
* Work on the visualizations page UI

**Additional Notes:**

* N/A
