## 1\. Liked

_What went well during the sprint?_

- Every task completed, apart from one
- Pushes & merging to the main branch is more seamless now–issues from last sprint were resolved

**Examples:**

- We were able to update multiple ADRs: code quality, technical decisions, and technology decisions
- We were able to clean up the project directory

## 2\. Lacked

_What could have been better or brought the team closer to success?_

- We could have paid closer attention to details when it comes to specific processes
- Trying more to keep items out of backlog will give us more time to finalize our repo before the code freeze

**Examples:**

- Remembering to include a reviewer and an assignee for each PR
- We weren’t able to complete unit testing for the home page

## 3\. Learned

_What lessons or insights were gained during the sprint?_

- We were able to adapt and move forward from struggles

**Examples:**

- Fixed our issues with pull request failure

## 4\. Longed for

_What do we desire to enhance success or morale in future sprints?_

- We’re aiming to iron out/plan out specific details of our code
- More communication over Mattermost for TA viewing and evaluations

**Examples:**

- Need to outline the dynamics of the homepage

**Next steps:**

- Complete unit testing for homepage
- Link the “auth” and “home” page
- Complete a code review to ensure it doesn’t look like more than one person wrote it
- Implement more dynamic elements into the home page
- Work on the visualizations page UI
