## 1. **Liked**  
*What went well during the sprint?*  
- Strong collaboration between team members 
- Interactions between pairs working on different parts of the pitch document were quite frequent

### Examples:
- While drafting the feature decisions section of the pitch document, Chirag and Krishi working on that part consistently communicated with June and Devanshi who were working on the user stories. This ensured our features align with user stories. 

---

## 2. **Lacked**  
*What could have been better or brought the team closer to success?*  
- More in-person interactions / Creation of channels on mattermost for better communication throughout the team

### Examples:
- Certain pairs of the team were unaware of the content of different parts of the pitch if their section was mutually exclusive, for eg: User stories pair wasnt aware of what was happening behind the scenes of Wireframing and Prototyping.

## 3. **Learned**  
*What lessons or insights were gained during the sprint?*  
- Creation of channels and constant updating must be a part of the team's routine

## 4. **Longed For**  
*What do we desire to enhance success or morale in future sprints?*  
- Trying to ensure we dont over-exaggerate our project in terms of features being implemented. We wish to keep our implementation as simple as possible and focus more on interactions and communication between individuals over tools and technology 

### Examples:
- More of in person meetings 
- Increase the frequency of updates
